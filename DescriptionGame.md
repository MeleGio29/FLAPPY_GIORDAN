# FLAPPY GIORDAN

INTRO: 
Flappy Giordan is a reinterpretation of the historical videogame "Flappy Bird".
Instead of the classic yellow bird...     ... my face has been inserted !!

After downloading the python code (game.py) and downloading all the images and the soundtrack, insert the code of the.hex file on the microbit.
When the python code is executed, pygame will start and the window with the video game will appear.

OPERATION:
If the 'a' key is pressed, the game will start from the microbit and for each press of that button the character will change his y.
If the 'b' key is pressed, pygame will be exited after a short sequence of notes emitted by microbit.

For each time the player passes through the pipes, the score will increase by 1.
